      <p>
        Our task was to create an autobiographical game. It had to tell the story of some aspect of ourselves. 
        We were required to use classes and objects to code our main character,
        switch statements to change scenes, for a total of three working scenes,
        and to implement a play again function.

        Design Process

      <p>
        First, I had to decide what kind of game I was going to make, and what story it would tell.
        Since cosplay and photoshoots are an important part of what I do outside of school
        (and sometimes inside), I decided to do a day in the life of myself, going to a photoshoot.
      </p>
  <p>
    I have a total of three scenes in my game. I wanted more, but my current coding skillset didn't allow for it.<br>
    Scene 1: Starts out in my room. I just woke up, and am on my way to the photoshoot. I decided to use PNGs of
    photos from past photoshoots. I have included my cat Sarge, since he's the one who usually wakes me up.<br>
    
    Scene 2: Photoshoot location. Usually, photoshoot take place at parks. They're public, free, and easy to get to
    (for the most part). The most popular one is Central Park, since that is the one with the most central location
    (hence the name). The NPC is a photographer. He's actually the one who takes most of my photos.<br>
    
    Scene 3: Back home. After the photoshoot, I come straight home. They usually end late (especially in the summer).
    Sarge is seen on my bed because of course he is. He likes anything soft and squishy. I don't blame him. Who doesn't? ðŸ˜‚
    Cat owner problems. <br>
    
    The scene then loops back to the first scene to play again.

      <p>
        My game is pretty bare bones. So much more happens on a photoshoot day, that I don't think I did it justice.
        I wanted more scenes and more details, but my current coding skillset didn't allow for that.
        I'm also unsure how to move my main character into classes and objects. I coded the PNG so that
        it carries across all the scenes. There's a high chance I'll have to redo this if I can't figure
        it out before tomorrow...

      <p>
        Our task was to create a data portrait of a habit of ours. We were asked to track a habit,
        translate it into an array, and then animate it using any concept we learned prior to this assignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        I chose to track how many times I fed my cat Sarge. I tracked from 10/05/2021 to 10/11/2021. An entire week.
        Whenever I fed him, I listed the times in a Word document.
        In code, I chose to represent the actual times as circles. The legend is under the map.
        
      </p>

        Reflection

      <p>
        I learned that the amount of times I feed Sarge depends on how much I'm home.
        Since half my classes are in person, I'm not home nearly as much as I was last year.
        This past weekend was unusually busy, as Comic Con was in town, so I wasn't home as much as I usually am on weekends.
        My cat has his own internal clock, so he's usually waking me up around 7 AM for food. 
        If I don't have to wake up early that day, I go back to bed after feeding him.
        As a student, I go to bed really late, so his last meal of the day is usually around midnight or 1 AM.
        Saturday amd Sunday should have a few more points, but my mom was visiting, 
        so she took some of the responsibility of feeding him.
      </p>

    I made a list of times, and grouped them together.
    I wanted them to correspond with the 6 colors of the rainbow,
    so I made 6 groups, using the 24 hour clock for ease of reading:</p>
    <p>
    Red = 7:00 - 7:59 AM <br>
    Orange = 8:00 - 8:59 AM<br>
    Yellow = 12:00 (noon) - 2:30 PM<br>
    Green = 4:00 - 6:00 PM<br>
    Blue = 8:00 - 8:30 PM<br>
    Purple = 12:00 (midnight) - 2:00 AM<br>
  </p>

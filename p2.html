        This week's assignment was to create a face generator using variables, parameters, mousePressed/MouseX/MouseY, and randomness.
        I decided to create a face that was similar to an emoji, something we're all familiar with.
        I used mousePressed, and kept everything at random to see what I would get. Most of the faces definitely resembled faces.
        Others, not so much...but that's the fun of it, right? Isn't whether or not something is a face arbitrary? Different people may have different ideas of what looks like a face to them.

      <p>
        The first part of this assignment was to sketch out a large face and a small face. 
        We could either use Photoshop, Illustrator, or sketch it by hand.
        By sketching out the minimum and maximum face sizes, we were then able to plug those numbers into P5JS to give the generator parameters.
        I have included these sketches below.

         This one was more difficult than the last. At first, I though we needed to make something smaller/larger and change to different colors, but then realized that it was about randomness and that everything should be left to random.
        I think I have the random color down, but not the random shapes. I had trouble figuring out how to anchor the eyes and mouth to the circle so that when it changed, those features would stay in the circle rather than go outside it.
        Expanding on the above idea of a face being arbitrary, in another class, we did an exercise. It was an art history class. 
        The teacher showed the class a few artefacts, and asked if we could see a face. On some of the pieces, all of us were able to see a face,
        on others, some of us had trouble seeing a face even once it was pointed out. 
        But, I would like to learn how to anchor features, how to change to a specific color on click, and how to change size upon click.

        P.S. I just realized I forgot to add a nose to my face. Whoops.

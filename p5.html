        Our task was to create an optical illusion using for loops, nested for loops, and if/else statements.
        We were supposed to take a pattern from our culture, and animate it in code.

      <p>
        Once again, I didn't actual sketch anything out beforehand. I had an idea and ran with it.
        My idea was to do a Pride Pokeball (from Pokemon) pattern. 
        So, I had a classmate of mine help me figure out how to get the the two tone of the regular Pokeball (red and white).
        After, I decided what I wanted to do with the pattern. I decided to have each Pokeball spin.
        I also received help from my professor. They helped me with the math and syntax of this assignment.
        Finally, I used an if/else statement to have the Pokeballs randomly change color.

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        Whenever I get an assignment that asks me to take from my "culture", I always trip up on it.
        I was adopted from China at 9 months old, and raised in the United States by Caucasian parents.
        So, I don't really know what my culture is since I don't really identify with the Chinese culture,
        but I don't identify with American culture since I don't think there is one. The U.S. is a melting pot,
        so everyone brings their own cultures with them. 
      </p>
  
  <p>
    I spoke to a different classmate about this, and they said that I can create my own kind of culture. 
        One that reflects all my experiences and values. It's still a work in progress, but I will get there
        eventually.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As far as this project, My original design was to have the Pokeball change color on mousePressed,
    but then I realized that I needed to incorporate an if/else statement. 
    At first, I had trouble thinking where I could use one. 
    I finally decided to use mouseIsPressed to create an experience similar to a disco ball.

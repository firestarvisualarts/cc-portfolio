        This week's assignment was to create an experimental clock, using if/else statements.

      <p>
        For the first part of this assignment, I was supposed to sketch out 3 clock types and choose one of those for the final one.
        However, I already knew what kind of clock I wanted to do, so I just went for it and started coding.
        I decided that, instead of my clock counting upwards, I wanted it to count downwards, like a timer. 
        I have it set to count down until midnight.

         This one was interesting. At first, I didn't know how to get it to count down. I worked on it with a classmate during lab this past Friday, and we got it to work.
        However, when my any part of my clock gets into the single digits, it looks a little odd since a 0 isn't added in front of it.
        I tried to employ the if statement of the if/else statements, to no avail. You can even see it in my code. 
        I don't actually know where I went wrong. This past Friday, my classmate tried it on her computer, and it worked, but for some reason, it doesn't work for me.

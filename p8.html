      <p>
        Our task was to create an experimental camera with a specific purpose or usage in mind. 
        We were given some questions to think about.

      <p>
        First, I had to decide what kind of camera I wanted to make and why. For reference, I decided to use self-portraits
        from a different class. One of my favorites (albeit, could have been executed better) was my first one. It had a sci-fi feel
        to it. That photo had a lot of post-processing done to get it to look that way. I wanted to try and code a filter similar to that.

  </p>

    I actually referenced the provided starter code. I didn't copy and paste. I retyped it out so I could learn. I played
    around with the colors to get the desired look. When looking up filters in P5JS, I came across a reference page with built in filters. I tried all of them, and
    landed on the Posterize filter. I overlaid that onto the already existing code.

      <p>
        I do think that it's important to bring up just how much everything has changed during quarantine.
        Before COVID, we already had a pretty strong selfie culture. But now, everything's about selfies
        and self portraits. As most of us know, many of our classes are over Zoom. So, the only part of each 
        other we see is the face.</p>
        
        <p>
         Photoshop, filters, and other software have been around for a while. With technology, it's
        easy to create a "perfect" version of oneself. This is the root of many unrealistic standards
        of beauty we are dealing with today.  </p>

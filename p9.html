      <p>
        Our task was to upgrade our experimental camera to be more consentful.
        We were to incoporate at least 1 DOM element.

      <p>
        The entire point of my experimental camera is that the filter changes color.
        I had originally coded the color change into function mousePressed, but realized
        that there wasn't anything that tells the user it can change color.
        So, I decided to add a button in the bottom left corner of the camera.
        I moved all the color changing functions into that button. It's supposed to make it very 
        obvious to the user that they can change color. I also added a reset button to return the
        camera to it's original state.

      <p>
        While there is no real consequence to the user not being aware that my camera can change
        color, it's good that they have the option to not change it. In my original camera, I could
        definitely see a user clicking the mouse to do something else, but it accidentally changes
        the filter color. In that case, the user also has a reset button to return the camera to 
        it's original colors. By adding these two buttons, my camera follows the FRIES model.

        This week's assignment was to take my assigned partners' drawings, and create a new one with parts from each.
        We were supposed to use user defined functions and arguments/parameters.

      <p>
        For the first part of this assignment, I was paired with my classmates Anna van Nieuwland and Tricia Ailena.
        Over Zoom breakout sessions, we showed each other our sketches, and assigned each other parts based off of skill.
        Since I am a beginner at coding, I took the simplest parts of everyone's drawings. 
        Each person was supposed to come up with a backstory for their character.
      </p>
  
  <p>
    Anna's was: my families last name ok my mothers side is “van leeuwen” which translates to “from lions” in English. 
    Last weekend my whole family came together to celebrate my grandparents 60 years of marriage. 
    This character is sort of the spirit animal behind our family and though it would be nice to tribute this project to celebrate them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tricia's was: I wanted to create a quirky-looking and cheerful human - including bright colors and abnormally long hands and legs!
  </p>

  <p>
    Mine was: I wanted to create a human version of my cat Sarge.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The new backstory: My character was once a feline that lived in a lab. The scientists loved him, and treated him well.
    One day, the scientists were doing an experiment, which went wrong. This resulted in the other animals (and scientists themselves) fusing with the feline.
    The lion's upper body, the scientist's head, and the feline's legs fused with each other to create a humanoid feline.

         This one was hard. One of the other parts to this assignment was to use user defined functions and arguments and parameters, but I had trouble incorporating that into my project.
        Since it was just use of primitive shapes, I ended up not using and functions or parameters. 
        Also, my partners forgot that we had to code the drawing, so they made intricate drawings that could easily be done in Illustrator.
        I'm a beginner a coding, so I opted to do the simplest parts of everyone's drawing. Even my own.
        We were interested in using Illustrator to draw the figure first, then put it into a code generator, but we were told that wasn't allowed.
        In the sketches above, I circled the parts I took in red.

        My lost object was pinky and purple.
Not sure which color was dominant.
My lost object had three wheels.
The third wheel was way smaller and was connected to the big wheel in the back by a plastic handle.
My lost object had a hard-aluminum-triangle thing that would connect both of the main wheels.
Again, pinky and purple. Had stuff written on... Don't ask what.
My lost object also needed my energy to move.
I didn't know how or why, but I knew that I could push the two pedals and that lost object would take me places.
Places like the corner of my street or my best friend's garage.
My lost object had a seat. Plastic and uncomfortable.
My lost object had a handlebar with a little bell. Loud and annoying.

        I first added the two circles for wheels. Then I added the triangles. After, I added the seat and handlebar.
        The gear and inside of the wheels came last. I assumed that it was a child's bike, so I used the brighter variants of pink and purple.

        This object was pretty easy to guess. Initially, I was unsure whether it was a tricycle or a bicycle, so I looked up photos of the two to compare. The smaller gear attached to the back wheel is what solidified the bicycle. I did end up using a reference photo of a bike off Google. I know that wasn't the point of the assignment, but I wouldn't have been able to make the drawing without it.

        My lost object is used to capture memories. 
It was black and silver. 
It was an analogue piece of technology. It used film and the product of its captures had to be processed manually before one could see what came out of it. 
It was an object commonly used by families and professionals alike. 
The bulk of its build was metal to ensure it was durable enough to withstand relatively harsh conditions or short falls.

        This design was easier than the first to code. It was a series of rectangles and circles.
        The rectangles went on first, then the circles. The colors went in last.
        Even though I'm pretty sure it looks more like a digital camera than a 35mm.
        I didn't look up an image for this, since that wasn't the point of the assignment.
        Even though I did with the bike above, I tried to limit the amount of things I looked up.
        Made the assignment more fun. Kind of like Pictionary.
      </p>

        This object was even easier to guess. Only a few things capture memories, those being cameras, film cameras, smartphones, and tablets.
        I actually used to own two 35mm cameras, but I had to get rid of them becuase they didn't work anymore. 
        If I remember correctly, mine were also black and silver. They were from my parents, and even though they had a case on them, they still seemed heavy and sturdy.
        Definitely made better than the DSLRs or digital cameras today. My mom always told me that back then, things were made to last. Nowadays, things are so delicate and break super easily.
        It makes me nervous with everything since I'm clumsy.
